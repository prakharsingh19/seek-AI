BS in Data Science & Applications from IIT Madras
___________________________________________________

A) Data Science & Applications
IIT Madras has launched the BS in Data Science and Applications. In this program, the course
contents are delivered online and can be studied by anyone from anywhere, while the monthly
quizzes and final semester exams will have to be attended in-person at designated centres.
Depending on the number of courses completed, learners can earn
●​ a Foundation level certificate
●​ Diploma in Programming/Diploma in Data Science or both
●​ BSc degree in Programming and Data Science
●​ BS degree in Data Science and Applications

1.

Highlights of the programme

Courses are taught by faculty of IIT Madras/other reputed institutes as well as experts from
the industry.
Unlike many competitive admission exams which work on the philosophy of elimination and
selection and admit a very limited number of learners into various programmes based on their
performance relative to that of others, in this programme there are specific qualifying criteria,
and a significantly large number of learners can enter.
Learners of any background, be it engineering, sciences, humanities, arts, medicine, law, etc
can attempt and join this programme.
There is no limitation on the age of the learner or their geographical location.

2.

Flexibility

There are two entry and four exit points, with learners being able to exit with either course
certificates, or diploma or the degree. Learners can choose their pace of study every term.
Being an online programme, there is no geographical barrier to learning from this programme
- learners only need to travel to exam centres for exams each term.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: This programme is NOT BASED on an admission process.
Qualified learners can attempt respective stages of the programme and those who clear each
stage will receive the certificate corresponding to that stage alone.

So, for example, the learner should be aware that they are not being admitted to a degree
programme after the Qualifier. It is only for the set of Foundation courses, which on
successful completion makes them eligible to enter the Diploma level. The diplomas or
degrees are obtained by the candidate only when the requisite number of credits are accrued
by completing the courses prescribed and satisfying any other mandatory criteria.
Admission to any level does not automatically entitle the learner to exit the programme with
the Diploma or the degree.

3.

Courses in the programme

3.1 Definition of credit in the program
The credits here are based on the UGC system of counting 14 hours of learner engagement
as 1 credit. (1 credit mentioned here would be equivalent to 3 credits in the current IITM
campus Credit system.)
The number of credits required to graduate with the BSc is 114 while that for the BS is 142.
The structure of the program is as follows:

3.2 Level 1: The Foundation level

The list of courses in the 3 tables here are subject to periodic revision.
2.​ Refer Credit Transfer for NPTEL Courses for process and credit transfer fee.
The course code defines the level of the course. If the course code is 2xxx,3xxx,4xxx then the
level of the course is 2/3/4 respectively.
The fee for the level 3 courses is Rs 2500/credit while that of level 4 courses is Rs 5000/credit.
Minor in Economics and FInance:
The minor in Economics and Finance can be earned by completing 2 mandatory courses,
namely Corporate Finance and Managerial Economics and one elective course from the list
below, to which more courses will be added shortly.
Game Theory and Strategy (Elective Already available)
These 3 courses can be credited within the 142 credits required for the BS degree. The Minor
can be earned only with the BS degree and not the Bsc degree.

A separate document will be issued by IITM stating that the Minor has been completed. There
will be no change in transcript or the degree certificate for those who do the minor.

The candidate can attempt again the subsequent terms.
They have to pay the full fees as per the fee norms applicable for their category. (and
additional exam facilitation fee in case of candidates outside India)
This will be considered like a fresh application and they have to redo the 4 weeks of course
work and weekly graded assignments and become eligible to get the hall ticket for the qualifier
exam

5.1.9 Options to register to courses once qualified
●​ Candidates who qualify in the first attempt within a term
○​ have the option to register to courses and continue with completing them in the
same term. In this case, qualifier score is treated as Quiz1 score to calculate
the Final score.
○​ Have the option to register to courses in the next 2 terms till when the qualifier
score is valid.
●​ Candidates who qualify in the second attempt within a term can ONLY register from
the subsequent term till the qualifier score is valid.
In a learner’s first term immediately following the qualifier exam, the qualifier exam scores and
assignment scores in the subjects registered will be considered as Quiz 1 score and first 4
assignment scores of the corresponding subjects.

5.2 JEE-based Entry into Foundation Level
There is a direct entry into the Foundation level of the program for students who have qualified
for the JEE Advanced Exams. Currently the validity of this is for the 3 terms following the
release of the JEE Advanced Eligibility list.
Candidates who qualified to appear for JEE Advanced 2022 can directly join our program in
the Sep 2023/Jan 2024 Term and Candidates who qualified to appear for JEE Advanced 2023
can directly join our program in the Sep 2023/Jan 2024/May 2024/Sep 2024/Jan 2025 Terms

The process will be as follows:
Apply to the Qualifier process, saying Yes to the question on eligibility to JEE Advanced level.
Upload a valid proof for the same.
●​ If the proof is found to be valid:
○​ The candidate will be declared eligible to join the Foundational level courses.
○​ They will be issued the admission letter.
○​ Such candidates can directly register to courses in the foundation level with
CCC as 4.

●​ If the proof document submitted is found to be not valid, the student will be moved into
the category of non-JEE and will be treated as a regular entry candidate to the
foundation level and have to go through the qualifier process.

6. Credit Clearing Capability
The value S used to determine the maximum number of courses that the learner is permitted
to register in a term is calculated as shown below.
●​ Term 1: decided by qualifier marks
●​ Term 2: decided by average of marks of all courses taken in Term 1 in which the
learner has passed
●​ Term n (n>2): M = average marks of courses passed in the previous two terms Term
n-1 and Term n-2 (This will be calculated using marks of subjects in which the
candidate has passed, not those which he/she has not passed or is not completed
yet); (n-1 and n-2 terms must be terms where the learner status is Active - defined in
section 11. Learner Life Cycle
Marks M (as defined above)

Maximum number of courses that learner
is permitted to register in any term

0 <= M< 50

2

50 <= M< 70

3

M >= 70

4

The credit clearing capability CCC will be decided as follows:
●​ If a learner has passed at least one course in term n-1, then the CCC of term n will be
calculated based on the marks as given in the above table.
●​ If a learner has failed all courses the learner has appeared for in term n-1, CCC of next
term n will be 2.
●​ If a learner is absent for final exam of all courses, thus not completing their courses
and not getting grades, CCC of next term = CCC of the learner’s last term

CCC is kept as 4 by default for
●​ everyone who chooses to register to courses in the same term as the qualifier exam
●​ For all JEE candidates in the first term
●​ For everyone in the Diploma and Degree levels

7. Course registration - steps involved
Students who are continuing with the program will go through the following steps to sign up for
the courses:
●​ Within the registration window, students will pick the courses they want to take in the
coming term, with limiting criteria on total courses registered being their CCC i.e learners
can register to maximum number of courses <= their CCC.
●​ Students pick 2 cities among the choices provided for their quizzes and exams for that
term.
○​ They have the freedom to choose a different set of cities than the ones they opted for
in the previous terms.
○​ Also they can choose a different set of cities for every quiz/final exam while registering
for the courses so that accordingly booking may be done with the Exam vendor for
slots in these cities.
●​ Students can register to courses for which the prerequisite is completed. The
pre-requisites are mentioned in 13.9 Prerequisite course requirements
○​ e.g. in order to sign up for Math-2, the learner must have cleared Math-1
●​ Students can take any course within a particular level of study but are not allowed to sign
up for courses across levels.
○​ Students who successfully complete all courses in the Foundation level will be eligible
for admission to the Diploma level program.
○​ Learners who successfully complete all courses in the Foundation and diploma
programme will be eligible for admission to the degree level, if they satisfy the
prescribed/regulatory criteria.
○​ Students who complete 114 credits as per the norms will be eligible for the BSc degree
and can continue onto the BS level.
●​ Learners pay only for the number of credits they are signing up for (online payment only).

8. Direct Entry into Diploma programme
For those who have the foundations to enter the Diploma programme directly and those who
wish to do just the Diploma and exit with it, this is a pathway. It is primarily aimed at working
professionals or learners who already possess the fundamentals taught in Year 1 of this
programme to enter the Diploma level directly.

A separate Direct Admission to Diploma (DAD) qualifier exam will be conducted for the
Diploma in programming (DP) and Diploma in Data Science (DS).
These are conducted on the same date as the end term examinations of the IITM BS
DS program. Hence these are conducted three times a year.
Any candidate crossing the cut off marks defined below will be eligible to enter the
Diploma Programme corresponding to the qualifier attempted and register to the
courses.
There will be no limit on the number of attempts by any candidate for direct entry,
though the recommendation would be that if they do not pass the qualifier, they
attempt through the foundation level.
The qualifier for DAD-DP will be a 3 hr exam, subjects being English, Aptitude and 6
weeks of Maths 1. Students have to study Computational Thinking, Introduction to
Python and then move on to the Programming Diploma subjects.
The qualifier exam for the DAD-DS will be a 4 hr exam, with subjects being English,
Maths 1, Statistics 1 and Python programming. Students have to start with Maths 2
and Statistics 2 and then continue with subjects in the Data Science diploma.

Students who have completed the Diploma in Data Science by Direct admission are directly
eligible to also pursue the Diploma in Programming, if they wish to, without attempting the
qualifier exam for this.
But students who complete the Diploma in Programming and wish to pursue the Diploma in
Data Science have to appear for the qualifier for DS as they would not have studied Statistics
1 and Maths 1 as part of course work.

9. Credit Transfer
Credit Transfer for NPTEL Courses
The following process is to be followed for credit transfer from NPTEL:
a.​ An NPTEL course of duration 4/8/12 weeks carries credit equivalence of 1/2/3 credits in
the BS degree program.
b.​ The learner must register for the NPTEL exam using the @ds.study.iitm.ac.in Email ID.
c.​ The learner has to register for NPTEL exams, pay the exam fee, and complete the NPTEL
course.
d.​ An NPTEL course can be transferred for credit only once and only to one program. The
learner has to give an undertaking that they are submitting this course for credit transfer
only to the IITM BS Degree program.
e.​ The NPTEL courses will be added in PASS/FAIL mode and counted towards the credits
with no letter grade and will not be included in the CGPA calculation.
f.​ The fee for credit transfer from NPTEL courses is fixed as Rs 1000/- per credit. Hence, Rs
1000/-, Rs 2000/-, Rs 3000/- should be remitted as fees if a learner opts for credit transfer
from NPTEL courses of duration 4/8/12 weeks. This fee is to be paid to the BS degree
program, and is separate from the fee to be paid to NPTEL to complete the course.
g.​ The learner can complete NPTEL courses any time after joining the Foundation Level
(using the official IITM email) and apply for the course credit transfer in the BSc/BS levels.
h.​ Refer the below table to know which term NPTEL courses can be transferred to which
term in BS
i.​ Students are required to pay the RKA fee if they are only doing a credit transfer in a term.

Credit Transfer from courses that are conducted on IITM
campus (**This will be in effect from January 2024**)
●​ A maximum of 24 credits can be earned from any campus courses.
●​ 24 Graded [from on campus courses of IITM], 24 non graded credits allowed
[apprenticeship, other institute, NPTEL]. MS (approve / reject) 28 credits [Theory (16
credits) + Apprenticeship (12 credits) ] allowed. 3 campus credits (from IITM) = 1 BS
credit.
●​ Students who have completed the foundation and the 2 diplomas and have cgpa of
>=8 will be eligible to earn credits from campus courses.
●​ The maximum number of credits that can be taken at the BSc level will be 8. These
credits are to be obtained from the Engineering, Science or Management departments.
●​ Students who have completed 114 credits in the IITM BS program and completed the
BSc level with a cgpa of >=8 will be permitted to credit 24-x credits at the BS level
where x is the number of credits they have earned in the BSc level from IITM campus
courses. A maximum of 8 credits can be transferred from the HS category in the BS
level, including the HS category credits earned through NPTEL.
●​ IITM BS students can apply to courses they are interested in and their acceptance will
be based on the availability of seats for the course.
●​ The fees for transferring the credits from each on-campus course will be Rs 2500/- per
credit of IITM BS program. The fee to be paid to the institute will be apart from this and
will be as per the institute norms.
●​ Students will have to attend the class in person unless a hybrid mode of accessing the
classes is available. The on-campus courses credited by the BS students will be listed
in the transcript along with the corresponding grades. The credits transferred from the
on-campus courses into the BS program will be counted towards the CGPA of the
student.

Applicable for the student who completed 142 credits:
Once a student completes 142 credits in term X and has not started any CGPA or
credit-earning courses in or before Term X, they will not be permitted to register any further in
the program and their BS degree certificate will be processed.
Case 2: If a student completes 142 credits in Term X and has started any CGPA or
credit-earning courses in or before Term X, they will have two options:

Case 2a: If the student chooses to complete the BS in term X and receive the certificate, the
CGPA or credit-earning courses will not be listed on the BS transcript.
Case 2b: If the student opts to receive the BS certificate only when the additional components
such as apprenticeship or other campus courses are completed, then the BS transcript will
include the credits for these also and the BS certificate will be generated after this.
Note: IITM Campus Courses are counted towards CGPA while apprenticeships and
on-campus courses from other institutes are counted only for credits and not CGPA.
.

Upgradation from Online BS in Data Science and Applications to MS
by research in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence
●​ Students with a CGPA≥8.0, upon completion of core courses at the degree level of the
BS program(at least 106 credits)shall be eligible to apply for the opportunity to
complete their remaining credits at the Department of DSAI,IIT Madras and continue
for an MS 9by research)degree.
●​ The BS program team will collate the applications and share the list of eligible
candidates with the Department of DSAI.
●​ The Department of DSAI will screen the applications(using a written test,interview,or
both) and shortlisted qualified candidates for this program.
●​ Selected candidates can complete the BS level (28 credits)by taking courses and
completing an 8-month
research
project (counted
under the
12-credit
apprenticeship) at the Department of DSAl,IIT Madras.
●​ Students who complete the BS level credits with a CGPA≥8.0 from campus
courses/projects shall continue for the MS(by research)degrees at the Department of
DSAl,IIT Madras.
●​ Students who complete the BS level credits with a CGPA <8.0 from campus
courses/projects shall not be upgraded to the MS(by research)degree. The credits
earned shall be transferred back to the BS program. Such students may apply for the
MS(by research)program by clearing the GATE exam.

10. Learner Life Cycle
Once a learner clears the qualifier, he/she will be eligible to register for the Foundation level.
Using their personal email id, they register to as many courses as permitted by CCC and
make the payment. After approval of the uploaded documents, the learner is given a
roll_number@ds.study.iitm.ac.in email id.
Henceforth all interactions on the portal right from login to accessing the learner dashboard
and courses will be via this email id.
There will be 5 statuses for any learner in the programme : On the rolls/Active, On Academic
Probation, Struck off the rolls, Alumnus, Quit the programme

●​ On the rolls/Active - When a learner is registered in any term for one or more courses
after paying the course fees, the status will be “On the rolls” or Active.
●​ On academic probation/Not registering to any course in a term:
After joining the programme, a learner may skip up to 2 terms consecutively without
taking any courses. In the two terms where the learner does not register for any
course, the learner status will be marked as “On Academic Probation”. The learner
email ID will still be kept alive while the learner is on academic probation.
○​ The learner can actively inform us about not registering to courses by paying the
“Registration keep alive fee (RKA)” of Rs 1000/- per term. In case of registering to
courses in the next term, the learners have to only pay the course fees.
○​ The learner may not pay the RKA and have it as pending to be paid. Pending RKA
will include 10% extra over regular RKA when re-registering back.
■​ To register to courses in the next term if not paid the RKA: The learner will
have to pay the pending dues = (which will be Rs 1100/- or Rs 2200/- (Rs
1000 RKA +10% as penalty for each term where no courses are
registered). The learner has to select the courses and pay the course fees.
Once they do this, the learner status is changed to "On the rolls".
●​ Struck off the rolls: If a learner with status “On Academic Probation” for 2 consecutive
terms does not register for courses in the next term too, the learner’s status is changed to
"Struck off the rolls". The official email id is suspended.
●​ Once struck off the rolls, to reactivate the registration, they will have to apply
through a separate process as defined:
●​ If the RKA for the previous 3 terms has already been paid, they have to request for
reactivating the email id on payment of Re-admission fee of Rs 2500/-. Once done,
they can register for the courses in the upcoming term.
●​ If the RKA for the previous 3 terms has not been paid, the learner has to apply to
activate his/her account by paying the pending dues which will be Rs 5800/- = Rs
2500 (Readmission fee) + Rs 3300/- (Rs 1000 RKA x 3terms+Rs 300 (10% as
penalty)). On receipt of the payment, the official email id is activated again and they
are permitted to register using this id. Once they do this, the status is changed to
"On the rolls".
●​ Any learner who is struck off the rolls 2 times, is removed from the programme.
●​ Quitting the programme: There will also be an option inside the candidate dashboard
which says "I quit the programme". Once the learner applies for this midway through a
level, we suspend the official email account and activate the personal email account to
access the dashboard. No reactivation for continuing the program is possible.
●​ Alumnus: Learners who complete the BSc level / BS level and quit the program, at the
end of it, we again suspend the official email id and activate the personal email
account to access the dashboard. Their status will be changed to “Alumnus”.
Students completing the foundation or diploma level and quitting the programme will have
status as “FL certified” and “DS certified”/”DP certified”/”Both diplomas certified” but will not be
awarded the Alumnus status.

Timeline for original certificate:
We need to get the senate approval before generating the original certificate. Senate meetings
will be conducted three or four times in a year. Please refer the below timeline for certificate
issue date
Note: Students who have completed the bsc and bs degree and wish to take their original
certificate have to mandatorily register with the IITM alumni association, pay the fees of Rs
6000/- and confirm to the BS team. Only after this will the original certificate be processed.

Photo Orientation: Students have to upload a passport size (JPG Format) photo in formal
attire with a blue background in high resolution.

11. Design of certificates for the 4 levels of the program
The design has been finalised for the 4 levels of certificates, as shown on the website.

Design for provisional certificates:

11.1 Mark transcripts
There will be 2 types of documents that will be made available automatically.
1.​ Term wise Progress card
This document will list all the courses taken by the learner term wise.
The values for every course will be course code, course name, level, grade obtained.
Note that the transcript will show all attempts and grades obtained in each of the
attempts.
2.​ Grade Card
This will have the courses at each level listed only once. The best score obtained
among all attempts for each course is what will be shown here.
GPA will be calculated for the courses in a particular term of the programme.
GPA=Σ𝑖(GPi*Ci)/ΣCi
Where GP = grade point of a course and Ci is the number of credits assigned to that
course and ΣCi is the total number of credits of all courses in the term, including those with
U or W grades.
The CGPA will also be computed for all unique courses completed until this point in time
with the best grade being considered in case a course is attempted multiple times.

11.2 Procedure to Apply for Official Transcript & Bonafide
Certificate
Students who are interested in applying for a transcript/bonafide certificate have to follow
these steps. Note that these certificates will be issued every Thursday. Students have to plan
suitably and contact us.

12.2 Course structure suitable for online delivery
All courses of 4 credits will be of duration 12 weeks.
The recorded content which is released every week will be for a total of about 2-4 hours, split
into multiple lectures which includes the theory and tutorial videos. All videos are copyrighted
to IIT Madras but will be available on YouTube as a public playlist for anyone to access and
view.
Self test assessments for every video lecture, a practice assignment for the week with
solutions will also be released apart from text transcripts and any related notes.
The weekly graded assignment will also be released along with the above content.

12.3 Evaluation and grading of courses in every term
Each course has 3 types of assessments - online weekly assignments, monthly in-person
proctored quizzes and an in-person end term exam.
1.​ Online assignments:
-​ A 12 week course will have one or more weekly assignments to be submitted online
within the due date specified.
-​ The average score of the best 5 out of the first 7 weekly assignments given during the
course run should be >= 40/100 to be eligible to write the final exam and get the hall
ticket for the same.
-​ This will also contribute to the Final score and course grade.(Score in any unattempted
assignment will be counted as 0).
-​ May change from course to course - check the grading document for actual details
2.​ 2 proctored Quizzes - to be attempted in person in the city chosen
Two quizzes will be conducted at the end of Weeks 4 and 8 based on the content of
Weeks 1-4 and 1-8 respectively.
-​ Will be a single session exam with 4 hrs to attempt 4 subjects, 3 hrs to attempt 3
subjects and 2 hrs to attempt 2 or 1 subject.
-​ The Qualifier score will be counted as Quiz 1 score for the courses registered in
the Foundation level only in the subsequent term of the qualifier exam, unless the
candidate attempts Quiz 1 again in which case the better of the 2 scores will be
used for calculations.
-​ The score of a quiz not attempted will be taken as 0. No make-up quiz will be
provided.
-​ At least one of the 2 quizzes has to be mandatorily attended by the candidate else
he/she will not be eligible to write the final exam. (check grading document for
changes)
3.​ Final end term exam at the end of the course

-​

-​
-​

At the end of a term, there will be an end term exam of 1.5 hours duration for each
course. (This will ensure exams can be conducted only on Sundays and exams for 4
courses completed in 2 sessions of 3 hrs each throughout the program.)
Eligibility to write the End sem exam: Pls check the grading document for details.
The final exam score accounts for 50% of the Total Course Score T - called End
Semester Score (E)

12.4 Pass criteria for each course
Total Course Score (T) will be the sum of all assessment components in every course as
defined in the Grading document of that term.
A candidate is deemed to have passed a course IF Total Course Score (T) >= 40/100
This criteria is the same for all learners in the course.
An absolute grading system, as described in the following table, will be followed:

12.5 Repeating a course
1.​ For improvement
A learner can repeat a course for improvement in grades any number of times. The fee
for repeating the course for improvement will be twice the regular course fee and the
learner will have to submit all the weekly assignments, appear for the quizzes and final
exams. The highest score amongst all attempts for a course will be used for calculating
the CGPA.
2.​ If learner was not eligible to attempt the end term exam (grade=WA/WQ) or if the
learner did not pass the course (Grade = U)
If average assignment score < 40/100 or no quiz attended or T<40/100, the learner
has to repeat the entire course. This includes submission of assignments and redoing
all the subsequent quizzes and the end term exam. Fees for repeating the course is
the same as the course fees.
3.​ If the learner was absent for the final exam alone (grade = I): The learner has 2
options:
a.​

Reappear for the final term exam - Makeup exam: They can attend only the
end term exam whenever it is conducted in the subsequent term.
●​ The fee to repeat an end term exam will be Rs.1000 for each course of the
foundational level and Rs. 2000 for each course of the diploma / degree
levels.
●​ If the learner reattempts the course in the immediate next term, then the
average Quiz Score Q will be carried over and the learner does not have to
resubmit the quizzes or the assignments.
●​ If the learner wishes to skip the immediate next term and attempt the
course in subsequent terms, then the entire course will have to be repeated
including the weekly assignments and quizzes.
●​ A learner can reappear for the makeup exam only once. If the learner
misses the makeup exam, then the learner has to repeat the entire course
in the term thereafter, by paying the full course fees and repeating all
assignments, invigilated quizzes and the end term exam.

b.​

Repeat the entire course: They can choose to repeat the entire course.
●​ The fee to repeat the course will be the same as the regular course fees.
●​ The learner must complete all assignments, invigilated quizzes and the end
term exam.
●​ Registering to this course will be counted as one of the courses permitted
as per the CCC of the learner.

Note: Learners repeating a course for any reason must do so within the time and term limits:
●​ Each level must be completed within 36 months (3 years / 9 terms).
●​ The entire programme must be completed within 96 months (8 years / 24 terms).

12.5.1 Registering for Courses: Term 2 Onwards
●​ Maximum number of final exams (full course+makeup exams) <= 4
●​ Maximum number of new + repeat full course (if failed/absent if reqd/improvement) <=
CCC
●​ Registering for new courses is subject to fulfilment of all rules and prerequisites.
●​ If a student passes all/some courses then CCC is calculated on the average of passed
courses.
●​ If a student fails all courses, then CCC is set to 2.
●​ If a student is absent for all courses then CCC of the previous term is carried forward.
●​ Make up exam will be permitted as an option only once in the subsequent term.

12.5.2 Repeating a Course - WA, WQ, U or I grade
Applicable for courses with WA, WQ, U or I grade.
You can choose to repeat courses in a single term or across multiple terms. You can also
register for new courses in the term. The total number of courses must be within the CCC
limit. Learners with an Incomplete (I) grade in a course can take a Make Up Exam instead of
repeating the course.

12.5.3 Repeating a Course for Improvement
Applicable for courses with A, B, C, D or E grade.
You can choose to repeat courses to improve the grade in the course. The highest grade will
be recorded in the transcript. The total number of courses must be within the CCC limit.
Course fee Repeat for Improvement courses will be double the normal fee. Improvement
courses can be registered at any level. Eg: Foundation course improvement can be registered
at diploma level.
Note: It is recommended that learners try and progress with new courses instead of repeating
courses for improvement, unless a learner deems it absolutely necessary or needs to improve
their learning of a course. All course material of completed courses are available to the learner
throughout the course.

12.5.4 Make Up Exams
Applicable for courses with I grade.
You can choose to take a Makeup Exam for a course with Incomplete (I) grade. Learners will
only be required to reappear for the Final Exam for that course. The Makeup Exam does not
count towards CCC, but a student can appear for a maximum of FOUR final exams in a term.

If you have already registered for 4 courses, you do not have any more final exam slots
available.
Note: The grading pattern for make-up exams will be as follows: the pattern used will be as
per the formula used in the term the course work was done and not as per the term the
makeup exam was taken.

Without completing all the 8 Foundation courses and the 12 Diploma level courses + 4
project courses, one cannot proceed to register for Year 3 Degree level courses.
Degree Level Courses:

Please note that L5_Degree courses are complex compared to Degree and L4_Degree courses. Course
fee and credits are same as L4_Degree courses.

14. Changes in project grading (wef now) and
Eligibility to enter the BSc Level (wef May 2024)
Here are two changes being effected with respect to project grading and eligibility to
enter the degree level.
1. Project grading:
So far - students had to complete all feature requirements given for a project, pass the
L1 viva and move onto the L2 viva and pass that too to get a pass grade.
Looking into the data we have, we understand that all students may not be equally
proficient in the areas of programming, machine learning and business and excel in all
4 projects.
Hence the grading is being changed as follows:

MAD1, MAD2, MLP projects: WEF current term
1.​ For MAD1 and MAD2 projects, when the submitted Application passes the check for
Appdev, L1 viva will be scheduled.
For MLP project, if the cutoff is crossed in the Kaggle contest and the student declares
that all the models have been completed, the L1 viva is scheduled.
2.​ There are 2 cutoff marks that will be decided for the L1 level for each term:
a.​ Cutoff1: X, Cutoff2: Y;
b.​ X<Y, X>0
3.​ The L1 viva will be conducted and scoring will be done based on the rubrics defined for
it. Based on the marks scored in L1 viva (L1_S), the following are the possibilities:
a.​ If (L1_S < X): Student has to resubmit the project. A few days are given for
them to resubmit in the same term. If the second time also, L1_S<X, they will
have to redo the project in the next term.
b.​ If (X <= L1_S < Y), then students are asked some additional questions for
assessing their knowledge and awarded D or E grade. Such students do not go
in for L2 viva at all. They will have a pass grade.
c.​ If (L1_S >= Y), L2 viva is scheduled for them.
i.​ If they pass the viva cutoff for L2, they get a grade including L1 and L2
scores.
ii.​ If they do not pass the L2 viva cutoff, they get one more chance at L2
viva.
iii.​ If they do not pass in the second attempt at L2 viva, they get an
appropriate grade (C or D or E) based on their L1 performance alone.
BDM project evaluation
So far: The process has been identifying the business, collecting data, analysing and sharing
their insights.
Going forward from Jan 2024:
Students will be allowed to web scrape data and analyse it, sharing the source from where the
data was taken. The BDM team will outline the steps involved.The maximum grade that the
student can earn in this case will be D.

Eligibility for entering degree level of the program: WEF May 2024
●​

●​

For a student to progress to the degree level (BSc) of the Data Science and
Applications program:
●​ they must secure a CGPA of 6.0 or higher at the end of two diplomas (includes
the courses in the foundation level and the diploma level and the projects)
●​ AND a CGPA of 7.0 or higher in all the projects completed at the diploma level.
These CGPA requirements are not applicable to students who exit the program with

●​
●​
●​

●​
●​

the diploma(s).
Such students who exit the program with the diploma(s) without meeting either CGPA
criteria will not be eligible for any certificates of academic achievements or prizes.
Students can repeat the theory courses any number of times within the stipulated
period for diploma level to improve the overall CGPA.
Students who have overall CGPA of 6.0 or above and CGPA<7.0 in projects, which
prevents them from entering the degree level, will be given one additional opportunity
to improve their project grades to earn the eligibility to progress to the degree level.
Students who cannot improve their CGPA above the required cut-offs must exit the
program with the diploma(s).
This rule shall be applicable to all students entering the degree level (BSc) from the
May 2024 term.

For those students who completed diplomas with less than 4 standalone projects (in Sep
2021/Jan 2022 terms projects were included in theory courses), whatever projects were done
standalone will be counted for the average CGPA of 7.0. For example, if 2 projects were done
as part of the theory and 2 projects standalone, then only the grades in the two standalone
projects will be used to compute the project CGPA. The projects done as part of the theory
courses will not be counted.
For those who do 4 standalone projects, eligibility to enter degree level is illustrated below with
some examples:

15. New Rules for Foundation & Diploma Level Completion
15.1 Foundation level checkpoints:
These conditions shall be applicable to the students admitted to the foundation level
from May 2024. These are not applicable for students who have entered in Jan 2024
term or before that. But completing the foundation level in 9 terms is applicable for all.
Students will be removed from the program if they do not complete
a.​ at least 4 courses within 4 terms.
b.​ at least 6 courses within 6 terms.
c.​ the 8 foundation courses within 9 terms.

The student will be issued warnings about insufficient progress and about complying with
these conditions starting from term 3.
15.2 Change in CCC at the foundation level:
This is for ALL students in the foundation level.
Currently, the CCC is calculated based on the courses passed in the last 2 terms by the
students and enforced too, deciding the number of courses that students can take in a given
term in the Foundation Level.
In view of the conditions imposed above leading to exit from the program if not satisfied, it was
proposed that the CCC will only be a recommendation and not enforced. This will enable
students to make up for term breaks and meet the proposed course completion criteria.
15.3 Increasing the maximum number of terms for completing the diploma level
The Diploma level can now be completed in a maximum of 12 terms instead of 9 terms
as has been the case till now. This extension of 12 terms as the maximum limit to
complete the Diploma level shall be applied for all learners, starting from the first batch,
who started the Diploma Level in September 2021.
The maximum duration for the BSc and BS levels shall remain unchanged at 9 terms. The
total duration permissible for the BSc and BS degrees shall also remain at 6 and 8 years,
respectively.
15.4 Checkpoints in the Diploma level
These conditions below shall be applicable to the students admitted to the Diploma
level from May 2024. These are not applicable for students who have entered in Jan
2024 term or before that.
To ensure continuous progress and steer students towards completing courses on time, the
following intermediate checkpoints were also proposed. The student must complete
a.​ at least 3 courses and 1 project in the first 3 terms from starting the Diploma
level - if not, they will be put on academic probation and given a warning.
b.​ at least 6 courses and 2 projects in the first 6 terms from starting the Diploma
level - if not, they will be removed from the program.
c.​ at least 9 courses and 3 projects in the first 9 terms from starting the Diploma
level - if not, they will be removed from the program.
d.​ All 12 courses and 4 projects in 12 terms from starting the Diploma level - if not,
they will be removed from the program
The student will be issued sufficient alerts and warnings about these checkpoints.

16. Eligibility Criteria Prize
The Direct admission to the Diploma, where students exit with the Diploma, comprises 8
courses and 2 projects (35 credits).
Eligibility for Prizes:

1. Certificate of Merit
Awarded to students at 2 levels: completing Foundation+2 Diplomas (86 credits),
completing the BS degree (142 credits)
Criteria: CGPA between 9.00 and 9.50 at the end of Foundation+2 Diplomas or when
graduating with BS.
2. Certificate of Academic Distinction
Awarded to students at 2 levels: completing Foundation+2 Diplomas (86 credits) or
completing the BS degree (142 credits)
Criteria: All students with CGPA greater than 9.50 at the end of Foundation+2 Diplomas
or when graduating with BS.
3. Certificate of Academic Excellence
Awarded to students at 2 levels: completing Foundation+2 Diplomas (86 credits) or
completing the BS degree (142 credits)
Criteria: The students with the highest CGPA at the end of Foundation+2 Diplomas or
when graduating with BS will be identified and awarded. The actual number of students
will be decided by the Steering committee.
Such students will be awarded a medal along with the certificate.
The following will be the process followed for identifying the students eligible for the awards:
a. The list of students completing the foundation+2 diplomas or the BS degree in a
calendar year January-December will be consolidated and considered to finalize the
prizes.
b. Certificates will be awarded for the 3 categories with medals being given for the students
identified as having the highest CGPA alone.
c. The students completing Diplomas through the Direct admission process will be
considered as a separate category and will be eligible for prizes in the highest CGPA
category alone.
Prize Eligibility Criteria for Improvement Courses
For the prizes awarded after the diploma level, we will consider the CGPA only till the term
when the student completes the two diplomas. Improvements in foundational/diploma courses
done after completion of both diplomas will not be considered for the diploma-level prizes. For
example, if a student had repeated a foundation/diploma course for improvement in
September 2023 but had completed both diplomas in May 2023, then the CGPA secured in
May 2023 will be considered for diploma-level prize. Diploma-level prizes will not be given
retrospectively.
For eligibility with respect to BS-level prizes, CGPA at time of completion of BS will be
considered.

with companies and research projects and earn up to 12 credits in this level. Doing an
apprenticeship is optional.
Steps involved in the Apprenticeship program:
1.​ Approval for the company/research project where the student can work as an
apprentice
If the student applies and is accepted by any of the companies that are preapproved
by IITM for this purpose, the apprenticeship will be directly approved.
Else the student will have to submit the details of the company/organization and the
Apprenticeship committee will decide based on the details submitted.
2.​ Reporting Manager
Once the apprenticeship is approved, the student has to submit the details of the
Reporting Manager in the Organization to IITM.
3.​ Logging the weekly work report
Student has to file the work log to IITM BS office every week.
4.​ Review after first 4 weeks
After 4 weeks, based on the student’s performance, the reporting manager has to
confirm if they would like to continue with the student as an apprentice for the next 7
months. This confirmation letter should be submitted to the IITM BS Program’s Office.
5.​ Possible exit after 4 months
After the completion of 4 months, the student or the company can choose to
discontinue the apprenticeship. A letter from the company has to be submitted
outlining the work done by the student and whether it was satisfactory to obtain partial
credits.
6.​ After the completion of 8 months of internship

A letter from the Reporting Manager should be submitted to the IITM BS program on
the company’s letterhead stating the work done by the student and whether it was
satisfactory.
The following will be norms with respect to pursuing an apprenticeship:
1.​ Number of courses that can be taken along while pursuing the apprenticeship
Students can pursue a maximum of 2 courses each term during the duration of the
apprenticeship.
2.​ Duration of the apprenticeship that can be credited - 8 months, full time
3.​ Academic Credits
a.​ <4 months: 0 credits.
b.​ 4<duration<8 months: 4 credits
c.​ 8 months: 12 credits
4.​ Stipend: This is mutually agreed upon between the student and the company when
finalizing the apprenticeship.
5.​ Mode of apprenticeship: Remote or On-site: This will depend on the company’s
policy.
6.​ Pre-placement Offer: On successful completion of the apprenticeship, companies will
have the option to give a pre-placement offer to the students.
7.​ Payment of fees:
The fee for credit transfer is fixed as Rs 5000/- per credit for Apprenticeship. When
students opt to credit this at the BS level, they have to pay the credit transfer fee at the
time of registration.
